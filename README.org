#+TITLE: rpm-spec-mode

A major-mode for editing RPM spec files.

The mode originated from XEmacs's prog-modes but diverged after sometime when
Stig Bjørlykke took over the development.

At some point the fork became the effective upstream.
For reference the historic ChangeLog entries from XEmacs are included in this
repository (see [[file:ChangeLog]]).

A copy of the original upstream prog-modes can be found below:
